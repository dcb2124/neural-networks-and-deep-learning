"""network2.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An improved version of network.py, implementing the stochastic
gradient descent learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network.
Improvements include the addition of the cross-entropy cost function,
regularization, and better initialization of network weights.  Note
that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and
easily modifiable.  It is not optimized, and omits many desirable
features.

           An extremely low random fluctuation in the accuracy basically caused 
           it stop. But I ended up with the highest accuracy, of 0.9635, of any
           of the tests so far. I guess with a higher learning rate, there is 
           more randomness, so you are not as sure of this method. If there is 
           a lower learning rate there is less noise, so this method is more 
           reliable. I guess you would need to index epsilon to the size of the
           learning rate. Because if epsilon is too low it will never stop, but 
           if epsilon is too high then it will be constantly stopping. This is 
           actually pretty good because it seems to be pretty noisy after epoch
           5 or so, and other test seemed to consistently average out around
           .9600. That means this was able to get rid of just under in 10 errors.
           But I actually realized I miscoded the learning rule.
           
           So aftrer you have done a lot of epochs, the model is going to be 
           essentially "baked" in. You shouldn't have to worry about the model
           fitting itself to much to the later accuracies where it is not 
           learning. Although, early on this may be a problem, if you start 
           to overfit very soon. But then you should probably adjust your
           hyper-parameters.
